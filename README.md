> Imagine it's the year 2035 and you are an
astronaut stuck in a broken spaceship
somewhere within the solar system. Your only
hope is to fix the spaceship before the oxygen
runs out. Luckily, thanks to your engineering
skills, you were able to isolate the problem which
is a bug within engine firmware.
The good news is that it‚Äôs only a software
problem that can be solved just by writing or
speaking the right commands to the computer.
The bad news is that the computer only understands Turkish.
The people at the command center on Earth can help you but they
only speak English.
